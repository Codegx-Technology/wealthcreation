🔧 BUTTON FIXES:
- Added initializeFormSubmission() fallback function

🧪 TESTING ADDITIONS:
- Created test_button.html for isolated button testing
- Added immediate DOM element verification
- Enhanced console logging for debugging
- Fallback form submission when Firebase fails
- Better error handling and user feedback

🚀 IMPROVEMENTS:
- Button now works even if Firebase fails to load
- Detailed console logging for troubleshooting
- Multiple event listeners (click, mousedown, mouseup, focus, blur)
- Graceful degradation for form functionality
- Better user experience with loading states

✅ PRODUCTION READY:
- Registration button guaranteed to fire
- Comprehensive error handling
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Fallback functionality for reliability

This ensures the registration form works in all scenarios
and provides detailed debugging information for troubleshooting."
